<div class="section" id="gather-requirements">
<span id="gather-requirements"></span><h2>Gather Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#gather-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the video the interviewer gave us requirements but they were intentionally vague. The first thing the interviewee had to do was to gather additional requirements to have a strong understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>This required communication on the interviewee’s behalf. They went as far as to talk through the given input, and create an output, that was verified as correct by the interviewer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="break-problem-down">
<span id="break-problem-down"></span><h2>Break Problem Down<a class="headerlink" href="#break-problem-down" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After successfully gathering the requirements the interviewee broke the problem down into two separate pieces. Identify what needed to be done first, and what needed to be done next.</p>
<p>Breaking the problem down gives the interviewee the opportunity to focus on one aspect of the problem at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pseudocode">
<span id="pseudocode"></span><h2>Pseudocode<a class="headerlink" href="#pseudocode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the interviewee has a hold on the separte pieces of their intended solution, they can begin working on the logic of the problem.</p>
<p>For the first chunk of their proposed solution the interviewee wrote “Loop over input, remove vowels”.</p>
<p>For the second chunk of their proposed solution the interviewee wrote “Loop over vowel-less str, remove odd index chars”</p>
<p>Psuedocoding the problem promotes communication around the proposed solution. It is a way to share thoughts with the interviewer without starting to code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="write-syntax">
<span id="write-syntax"></span><h2>Write Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#write-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have a plan, and a map drawn out in the form of our pseudocode we can start coding!</p>
<p>You’ll notice the interviewee is talking through their actions as they write code down. This shows the interviewee has the ability to communicate effectively with another developer.</p>
<p>As you write syntax you may find that you still don’t have all of the requirements. In this video the interviewee did not know if the letter ‘y’ was considered a vowel. To overcome this confusion they simply asked the interviewer for more clarity on the requirements!</p>
<p>While writing their code, occasionally the interviewee would realize they didn’t declare a variable before, or forgot to include something above their already written code. That is okay! You want to show the interviewer your problem solving process, and very rarely will you write something perfect from top to bottom. Don’t hesitate adding new lines above your already written solution if you need to declare more variables!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="test">
<span id="test"></span><h2>Test<a class="headerlink" href="#test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After the interviewee finishes the first version of their solution they need to test it! As programmers we don’t usually get the right answer on the first try, and without our debugger to point us in the correct direction we are left to walking through a test case ourselves.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the interviewee keeps track of the variables throughout the entire program, by writing them on the board, and updating them as they walk through the program line by line.</p>
<p>At the end of the program the interviewee can compare their produced answer and compare it to the answer that was agreed upon when they gathered the requirements of this problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-changes">
<span id="make-changes"></span><h2>Make Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#make-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When testing your solution, you will more than likely find that you made a mistake. It may be a small mistake, or a big mistake. Making a mistake can be a great thing in a live coding session. Take a step back, and try to figure out where the mistake is happening. This is usually very apparent in the testing phase, if you test line by line, you should see when mistakes happen, when they occur in your code.</p>
<p>You want to show the interviewer you have strong problem solving skills, and part of problem solving is being able to figure out mistakes you have made in your own solution, and then fixing them.</p>
<p>If you find a mistake in your solution, great! Fix the mistake, and test your solution again.</p>
